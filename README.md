The R Code will take input file as attached (Loktra_Data)
The input file(LOktra_Data) is modified in excel. Two columns created namely Class & Text.
There are 9 Models classifying a particular row of text.
Voting from these 9 models is considered for final Predicted Class.

We have 99.18% Accuracy as seen in Confusion Matrix (45 text rows classified incorrectly out of 5485)

According to the scoring mechanism stated in the problem statement : Accuracy_Scoring_Meachanism_LOKTRA = [(Correctly Classified - Incorrectly Classified)/Total]

The Ensemble model is giving out a score of 98.35.
